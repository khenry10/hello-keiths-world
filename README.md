#  Hello Keith's World

### Overview

Keith's Hello World is a mapping app to highlight the different places I've attended school and worked, with commentary and dates.  The tour button starts a brief demo and brings the user to each location in chronological order.  A user can also click on the markers in order to display the tooltip.

### Technology

I used Mapbox's GL JS API for the mapping components.  The markers are using validated geoJSON and I utilized the flyto method with zooming and bearing for click-action effects. The site is mostly javascript with some HTML/CSS and is hosted on github pages.

### Feature Backlog:
 * add logos
 * include road trip as a separate experience
 * change mapping style depending on the marker location to highlight interesting geographic features (like the extinct volcano across from the farm in California)
